								<h2>Aspiring Software Engineer</h2>
								<p>
									Welcome! I believe in developing processes that are simplified, yet powerful, that are precisely implemented. In my career, I am setting out to develop programs and software that will empower people and organizations to reach their goals. I endeavor to work together with a team to further the field of Software Engineering through our work.

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/dragons_photo.jpg" alt="a warrior holding a battle axe on a ship, looking off into the distance at two dragons flying in the sky over the water" /></span>
								<h3>Language: Python</h3>
								<p>This game is something I developed during my Back End Certificate with Nucamp. In this game, the player selects one of four characters to battle the dragon, as well as a game difficulty level. The caracter then battles the dragon until there is a winner. Give this game a try to see if you can defeat the dragon! </p>
								<h3>Features of this game include:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>
										12 ways to play the game that are chosen by the player, which includes: Three difficulty levels which alter the dragon's hp and attack strength to make it more difficult to battle and four character options for the player to choose, each with unique "hp" and "attack" strength
									</li>
									<li>
										The game continues to play until the player decides to exit the game
									</li>
									<li>
										The player may enter either a number or a name of the character they would like to choose and is not case sensitive. Same concept for choosing a difficulty level.
									</li>
									<li>
										The game keeps track of the player's character's HP remaining, as well as the dragon's and reports this throughout the game to the player and gameplay continues until the score is zero. 
									</li>
									<li>
										Customized game messages using string concatenation help the player understand how many times they have played the game and what is occurring in the game. 
									</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Code Features:</h3>
								<p>While loops, if/elif/else statements, conditional statements, string concatenation, infinite while loops, user selected options, variable declaration</p>
								<h3>Files:</h3>
								<p>The dragon_fight.py file on GitHub contains the entire program.</p>

									</li>
									<li>
										Once account is created, user must log in.
									</li>
									<li>User may log-out at any time</li>
									<li>Different functions defined and called upon to show balance, deposit, withdraw, and log-out. </li>

								<h2>About Tyler Schwaegler</h2>
								<p>
									I am an experienced administrator with experience wearing multiple hats in an organization interested in a career in Software Engineering. Overall, I have with 7+ years of experience in higher education administration between the United States and Europe. Currently, I serve as the Assistant Director for Assignments, Marketing and Communication at Tulane University, with leadership responsibilities in department operations, staff recruitment, and technology. 
								</p>	
								<p>
									I believe in developing processes that are simplified, yet powerful, that are precisely implemented. In my career, I am setting out to develop programs and software that will empower people and organizations to reach their goals. I endeavor to work together with a team to further the field of Software Engineering through our work. I enjoy work on the "back end" of systems and processes - the work which builds the foundation for what is needed for people and organizations to be successful.  I enjoy collaborating with my team to tackle problems, test code, and problem-solve, and continually enjoy finding new ways to innovate to make even more of an impact in our daily work. I view myself as a life-long learner, and I am always looking for new opportunities to grow and develop my skills, grow with a team, and grow within an organization. I am looking for a Software Engineering opportunity where I can make impactful contributions to my team, while also developing my own skills and opportunities. I am motivated to succeed in my new career as I transfer my skills from higher education administration and educational technology realms. 
								</p>
								<p>
									I have completed the NuCamp Web Development Fundamentals certificate as well as the Data Structures and Algorithms certificate, and am currently enrolled in the remainder of the Back End, SQL and DevOps with Python certificate course, with a graduation in July 2022. I look forward to continuing to starting a career in Software Engineering.
								</p>
								<p>
									I enjoy taking spin classes, running, caring for my two dogs, studying Luxembourgish, grilling in my backyard, studying back end development and web development, spending time with my friends and family, traveling, and exploring my city! I invite you to check out my LinkedIn and my coding projects on GitHub to learn more about me.
